When working with Bash and shell scripting, you might need to check **whether a directory or a file exists** or not on your filesystem.

Based on this condition, you can exit the script or display a warning message for the end user for example.

In order to check whether **a file or a directory exists with Bash**, you are going to use “Bash tests”.

In this tutorial, you are going to learn **how to check if a file or directory exists in a Bash script**.

## Check If File Exists

**In order to check if a file exists in Bash, you have to use the “-f” option (for file) and specify the file that you want to check.**

```
if [[ -f <file> ]]
then
    echo "<file> exists on your filesystem."
fi
```

For example, let’s say that you want to check if the file “/etc/passwd” exists on your filesystem or not.

In a script, you would write the following if statement.

```
#!/bin/bash

if [[ -f "/etc/passwd" ]]
then
    echo "This file exists on your filesystem."
fi
```

### Check File Existence using shorter forms

In some cases, you may be interested in checking if a file exists or not directly in your Bash shell.

**In order to check if a file exists in Bash using shorter forms, specify the “-f” option in brackets and append the command that you want to run if it succeeds.**

```
[[ -f <file> ]] && echo "This file exists!"

[ -f <file> ] && echo "This file exists!"
```

Using the example used before, if you want to check if the “/etc/passwd” file exists using shorter forms, you write the following command

```
[[ -f /etc/passwd ]] && echo "This file exists!"
```

![check if file exists using shorter form](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/check-file-shorter.png)

*So how does this command work?*

Shorter forms are closely related to **[exit statuses](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exit-status.html)**.

When you run a command on Bash, it always exits with an error status : 0 for error and numbers greater than 0 for errors (1, 2.. 6 and so on)

In this case, [the “&&” syntax](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Lists.html) will check if the exit status of the command on the left is equal to zero : if this is the case, it will execute the command on the right, otherwise it won’t execute it.

> **Protip** : you can use “echo ${?}” in order to see the exit status of the latest command run

### Checking multiple files

In some cases, you may want to check if multiple files exist on your filesystem or not.

**In order to check if multiple files exist in Bash, use the “-f” flag and specify the files to be checked separated by the “&&” operator.**

```
if [[ -f <file1> ]] && [[ -f <file2> ]]
then
  echo "They exist!"
fi
```

## Check If File Does Not Exist

On the other hand, you may want to check if a file does not exist on your filesystem.

**In order to check if a file does not exist using Bash, you have to use the “!” symbol followed by the “-f” option and the file that you want to check.**

```
if [[ ! -f <file> ]]
then
    echo "<file> does not exist on your filesystem."
fi
```

Similarly, you can use shorter forms if you want to quickly check if a file does not exist directly in your terminal.

```
[[ ! -f <file> ]] && echo "This file does not exist!"

[ ! -f <file> ] && echo "This file does not exist!"
```

![check if a file does not exist in bash](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/check-file-does-not-exist-shorter.png)

Note that it is also possible to check if a file does not exist using the “||” operator.

The “||” operator will execute the command on the right if and only if the command on the left fails (i.e exits with a status greater than zero).

To test if a file does not exist using the “||” operator, simply check if it exists using the “-f” flag and specify the command to run if it fails.

```
[[ -f <file> ]] || echo "This file does not exist!"
```

## Check If Directory Exists

**In order to check if a directory exists in Bash, you have to use the “-d” option and specify the directory name to be checked.**

```
if [[ -d "$DIRECTORY" ]]
then
    echo "$DIRECTORY exists on your filesystem."
fi
```

As an example, let’s say that you want to check with Bash if the directory /etc exists on your system.

In order to check its existence, you would write the following Bash script

```
#!/bin/bash

if [[ -d /etc ]]
then
    echo "/etc exists on your filesystem."
fi
```

When executing this script, you would get the following output

```
Output

$ /etc exists on your filesystem
```

### Check Directory Existence using shorter forms

In some cases, you may be interested in checking if a directory exists or not directly in your Bash shell.

**In order to check if a directory exists in Bash using shorter forms, specify the “-d” option in brackets and append the command that you want to run if it succeeds.**

```
[[ -d <directory> ]] && echo "This directory exists!"

[ -d <directory> ] && echo "This directory exists!"
```

Let’s say that you want to check if the “/etc” directory exists for example.

Using the shorter syntax, you would write the following command.

```
[ -d /etc ] && echo "This directory exists!"
```

## Creating a complete Bash script

If you find yourself checking multiple times per day whether a file (or multiple) exists or not on your filesystem, it might be handy to have a script that can automate this task.

In this section, you are going to create a Bash script that can take multiple filenames and return if they exist or not.

If they don’t, a simple notification message will be displayed on the standard output.

Create a new Bash script and make it executable using [chmod](https://devconnected.com/linux-file-permissions-complete-guide/#a_Using_chmod).

```
$ mkdir -p ~/bin 

$ cd ~/bin && touch check_file && chmod u+x check_file && vi check_file
```

Here is the content of the script to be used to dynamically check if files exist.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Using argument expansion to capture all files provided as arguments.

for FILE in ${@}
do
  if [[ ! -f $FILE ]]
  then
    echo "The file ${FILE} does not exist!"
  fi
done
```

Save your script and add the “bin” folder you just created to your PATH environment variable.

```
$ export PATH="~/bin:$PATH"

$ printenv PATH

~/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

Now that your script is accessible wherever you are on the system, you can call your script and start checking if files exist or not.

```
$ check_file /etc/passwd /etc/pass /etc/file

The file /etc/pass does not exist!
The file /etc/file does not exist!
```

Awesome!

You created a custom to check whether files exist on your filesystem or not.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learnt how **you can check if a file exists or not** using Bash tests and Bash short syntax.

Similarly, you learnt how it is possible **to verify if a directory exists**.

Finally, you have written a complete Bash script that accepts dynamic arguments in order to check if multiple files exist or not.
