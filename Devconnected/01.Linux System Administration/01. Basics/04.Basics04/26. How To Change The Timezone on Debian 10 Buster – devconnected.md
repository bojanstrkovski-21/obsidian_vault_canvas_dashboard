On Linux, it is essential to have some basics when it comes to **changing the timezone**.

The timezone is a parameter set at the installation stage and that determines **the current date** for your host.

Setting a correct timezone is **crucial** : your web and application servers may rely on this date for deserializing for example.

As a consequence, you want to set the timezone to an information that reflects the timezone you are currently located in.

On Debian 10, there are three ways to change the timezone :

-   By using the **timedatectl** command with the **set-timezone** option
-   By creating a **symbolic link from your /etc/localtime to the correct timezone**.
-   By using the **TZ environment variable**

## Prerequisites

In order to change your timezone on Debian 10, you will need to have [sudo privileges on your host.](https://devconnected.com/how-to-add-a-user-to-sudoers-on-debian-10-buster/)

## Change the timezone using timedatectl

The quickest way to modify the timezone is to use the **timedatectl command**.

### Showing your current timezone

To see the current timezone used on your host, run the following command

```
$ timedatectl
```

![Print current timezone on Debian](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/timedatectl.png)

Note that it is equivalent to run the command with the **status** option.

```
$ timedatectl status
```

As you can see, you are presented with the local time (the time in your timezone), [the universal time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Time), the RTC time but most importantly the time zone.

Currently, my timezone is set to **America/New York.**

In order to see all the timezones available on your distribution, run the following command

```
$ timedatectl list-timezones
```

![List available timezones on Debian 10 Buster](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/list-timezones.png)

If you already have an idea of the timezone you want to select, you can narrow down your results to pinpoint the exact matching timezone.

```
$ timedatectl list-timezones | grep Paris
```

### Setting a new timezone

In order to set the current timezone, use the **set-timezone** option with the timezone as an argument.

```
$ timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Paris
```

No need to restart any services, your timezone will be changed immediately.

To verify it, you can the timedatectl command again, or a simple date command.

```
$ timedatectl
$ date
```

## Change the timezone by creating a symbolic link

The second method to change to timezone is **to create a symbolic link from your /etc/localtime to predefined timezones available on your host.**

> Looking to understand more about [hard and soft links on Linux](https://devconnected.com/input-output-redirection-on-linux-explained/), read the complete guide!

This is an old method, and you should be fine by simply running timedatectl. But in case you need to create a symbolic link, here is how you would do it.

By default, timezones are stored in the **/usr/share/zoneinfo** directory of your host.

Here is for example the content of the Europe folder

You will be able to change your timezone by pointing your **localdate** file to one of those files.

To do it, run the following command

```
$ sudo ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Shanghai /etc/localtime
```

To verify that your changes were correctly applied, make sure to run the date command.

```
$ date 
```

## Change the timezone using the TZ environment variable

First of all, in order to determine the timezone we are interested in, we are going to use the **tzselect** command.

The tzselect command is an **interactive tool that guides the user towards the timezone syntax to use on its .profile file**.

It means that the tzselect won’t modify the timezone, but it will provide you with the commands you have to write to modify it.

```
$ tzselect
```

![Changing timezone on Debian 10 using the TZ environment variable](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tzselect.png)

Select the timezone you are interested in by typing the number corresponding to the entry.

```
#? 7
```

From there, you will be presented with a list of countries. Choose the one you are interested in.

![Tzselect utility contextual menu](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/france-15.png)

If you agree with the information shown in the terminal, simply hit “1” and press Enter.

![Changing timezone by modifying the TZ environment variable](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/final-screen.png)

As specified, append the following line to your .profile file.

```
echo "TZ='Europe/Paris'; export TZ" >> /home/<user>/.profile
```

Verify that your changes were correctly appended to your .profile file.

```
$ tail -n 1 /home/<user>/.profile
TZ='Europe/Paris'; export TZ
```

Log out from your account and log in again for your changes to be taken into account.

On the next login, verify that the **TZ environment variable** is correctly set

```
$ echo $TZ
Europe/Paris

$ date
Wed 18 Sep 2019 11:25:36 PM CEST
```

Awesome, you have successfully changed the timezone on your Debian 10 Buster instance.
