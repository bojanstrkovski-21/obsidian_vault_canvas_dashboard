*This tutorial focuses on adding sudoers rights to a user on Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa.*

When managing an Ubuntu 20.04 server, it is actually quite important to know **how to add sudoers to it**.

The **sudo** command is a very popular command on Linux.

It allows unauthorized users to perform commands as another user, by default being the root user.

On Ubuntu 20.04, we will focus on three different ways to add a user as sudo : **add it to the sudo group, to the sudoers file or using the graphical interface.**

Here are the details of the three different methods.

-   [Adding an existing user to the sudo group](#Adding_an_existing_user_to_the_sudo_group "Adding an existing user to the sudo group")
    -   [Adding a user to sudoers using gpasswd](#Adding_a_user_to_sudoers_using_gpasswd "Adding a user to sudoers using gpasswd")
-   [Adding an existing user to the sudoers file](#Adding_an_existing_user_to_the_sudoers_file "Adding an existing user to the sudoers file")
    -   [Tweaking password verification](#Tweaking_password_verification "Tweaking password verification")
-   [Adding a user to sudoers using the graphical interface](#Adding_a_user_to_sudoers_using_the_graphical_interface "Adding a user to sudoers using the graphical interface")
-   [Adding a group to the sudoers file](#Adding_a_group_to_the_sudoers_file "Adding a group to the sudoers file")
-   [Conclusion](#Conclusion "Conclusion")

## Adding an existing user to the sudo group

On most distributions, it is very likely that the [sudo command](https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.8.28/sudo.man.html) is available by default.

```
$ which sudo
```

> **Note** : the “which” command can be used in order to verify the existence of the sudo command on your host.

![which sudo command](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/which-sudo.png)

If you notice that this is not the case, you can install sudo by running the following commands.

```
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install sudo
```

**In order to add a user to sudoers, you have to use the “usermod” command and the capital G (for secondary groups).**

```
$ sudo usermod -a -G sudo <user>
```

![adding a user to sudo using usermod](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/usermod-sudo.png)

In order to verify that your user was correctly added to the sudo group, you have to use the “groups” command.

If you see “sudo” as a secondary group for your user, congratulations, **you successfully added your user to sudoers!**

### Adding a user to sudoers using gpasswd

A less popular, yet very powerful way to add a user to sudoers is to use the **gpasswd** command.

```
$ sudo gpasswd -a <user> sudo
```

![gpasswd command](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gpasswd.png)

As a quick reminder, [gpasswd](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gpasswd.1.html) is used in order to administer the “**/etc/group**” file on your filesystem.

## Adding an existing user to the sudoers file

By default, on Ubuntu 20.04, the sudoers file is located at /etc/sudoers.

![sudoers file on linux](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/sudoers.png)

This file contains a set of rules that are applied in order to determine who has sudo rights on your system.

Also, the sudoers file can define **privileges** such as the commands that can be executed with or without sudo, or if you should be prompted with a password.

By default, **you should not modify the sudoers file by yourself** (the same logic applies to cron jobs for example).

If you were to corrupt this file, you might would not be able to get sudo rights again.

Instead, you are going to use “**[visudo](https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.8.17/visudo.man.html)**” : a tool designed to make sure that you don’t make any mistakes.

```
$ sudo visudo
```

![visudo linux](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/sudo-visudo.png)

At the end of the file, add a new line for the user.

```
john       ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

![sudoers syntax](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/sudoers-syntax.png)

By saving and exiting the file, the user “john” will be automatically added to the sudo group.

By default, the account password will be asked every **five minutes** in order to perform sudo operations.

If you want to remove the password verification, you can simply add the “NOPASSWD” option.

```
john       ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

> **Note** : if you add a user to the sudoers file, it does not mean that the user will belong to the sudo group on the system. It will be authorized to perform sudo operations, but it won’t be listed if you use the “groups” command.

### Tweaking password verification

If you want to tweak the password verification period, or if you want to increase the verification, you have to modify the “**timestamp\_timeout**” parameter.

```
# /etc/sudoers
#
# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.
#
# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.
#

Defaults        env_reset
Defaults        mail_badpass
Defaults        secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
Defaults        timestamp_timeout=30
```

In this case, the password will be asked every **thirty** minutes.

## Adding a user to sudoers using the graphical interface

On recent Ubuntu distributions, it is possible to **add a user to the sudo group** very easily.

First, head over to the “**Activities**” tab located at the top left corner of your screen and type “**Users**“.

You should see a screen similar to this one.

![activities tab on ubuntu](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/users.png)

Next, you will have to unlock the panel by clicking on “Unlock”.

![unlocking the user panel](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/unlock.png)

You will be asked for your password, note that the account has to be a privileged account in order to perform this operation.

![authentication required](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/authentication-required.png)

Now that the panel is unlocked, you can tick the “**Administrator**” radio button in order for your user to be part of the administrators!

![administrator option on ubuntu](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/john-sudo.png)

You can even verify that your user is part of the sudo group using the “**groups**” command.

```
$ groups john
```

![groups command](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/groups-john.png)

Congratulations, your user is now part of the sudo group!

## Adding a group to the sudoers file

In the previous section, we added a user to the sudoers file, *but what if you wanted to give those rights to an entire group?*

**To add a group to the sudoers file, add a “percent” symbol at the beginning of the line, just before the name of the group.**

```
%sysadmins       ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

Next, make sure that you are part of the designed group and execute your command using “sudo”.

```
$ groups
user sysadmins

$ sudo passwd
```

**Congratulations, you set “sudo” privileges to an entire group!**

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learnt how you can easily add a user to sudoers using three different methods : **using the command-line, the visudo command or using the graphical interface.**
