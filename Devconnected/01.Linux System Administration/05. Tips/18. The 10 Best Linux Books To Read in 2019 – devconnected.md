*This tutorial focuses on the best Linux books that you should read to become a professional system administrator.*

First released in September 1991, the **Linux kernel** was designed with home PCs in mind.

Since then, Linux has become a go-to operating system for much larger platforms, such as servers, supercomputers, and cloud computing, as well as the small, handy devices we keep on our persons at all times; smartphones.

Needless to say, the Linux kernel is a **versatile**, **open source operating system**, or OS, worth looking into.

Unfortunately, acquiring the information you need to get up to speed with the OS is a decent challenge.

There are loads of Linux books on the market today, covering a wide range of skill levels, many of which may not suit your unique situation.

## Conclusion

As I repeat it in many of my articles, there is a time for **theory** and a time for **practice**.

As a system administrator, you have to practice a lot in order to get efficient at what you are doing.

Even if you may choose to order some of those books, you have to install your own distribution in order to launch the commands by yourself.

For that, I would recommend starting with one of those tutorials in order to get started with Linux :

-   [How To Install and Configure CentOS 8 with GNOME](https://devconnected.com/how-to-install-and-configure-centos-8-with-gnome/)
-   [How To Install and Configure Debian 10 Buster with GNOME](https://devconnected.com/how-to-install-and-configure-debian-10-buster-with-gnome/)

As always, we have a complete section on **Linux administration** on the website, so make sure to check it to get more information on the subject.
