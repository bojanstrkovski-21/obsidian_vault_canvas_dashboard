From all the compression methods available, **Zip** is probably one of the most popular ones.

Released in 1989 by Philip Katz, [Zip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)) is widely used by system administrators in order **to reduce the size of bulky files and directories on your system.**

Nowadays, Zip is available on all operating systems on the market : whether it is Windows, Linux or MacOS.

With zip, you can **easily transfer files** between operating systems and **[save space](https://devconnected.com/how-to-check-free-disk-space-on-linux/)** [on your disks](https://devconnected.com/how-to-check-free-disk-space-on-linux/).

In this tutorial, we are going to see how you can easily **zip folders and directories on Linux using the zip command.**

## Zip Folder using zip

**The easiest way to zip a folder on Linux is to use the “zip” command with the “-r” option and specify the file of your archive as well as the folders to be added to your zip file.**

You can also specify multiple folders if you want to have multiple directories compressed in your zip file.

```
$ zip -r <output_file> <folder_1> <folder_2> ... <folder_n>
```

For example, let’s say that you want to archive a folder named “Documents” in a zip file named “temp.zip”.

In order to achieve that, you would run the following command

```
$ zip -r temp.zip Documents
```

In order to check if your zip file was created, you can run the “ls” command and look for your archive file.

```
$ ls -l | grep .zip
```

Alternatively, if you are not sure where you stored your zip files before, you can [search for files using the find command](https://devconnected.com/how-to-find-locate-files-on-a-linux-system/)

```
$ find / -name *.zip 2> /dev/null
```

## Zip Folder using find

Another great way of **creating a zip file for your folders is to use the “find” command on Linux**. You have to link it to the “exec” option in order to execute the “zip” command that creates an archive.

If you want to **zip folders in the current working directory**, you would run the following command

```
$ find . -maxdepth 1 -type d -exec zip archive.zip {} +
```

![zip folders using find command on linux](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/create-zip.png)

Using this technique is quite useful : you can choose to archive folders recursively or to have only a certain level of folders zipped in your archive.

## Zip Folder using Desktop Interface

If you are using GNOME or KDE, there’s also an option for you to zip your folders easily.

### Compress Folders using KDE Dolphin

If you are using the KDE Graphical Interface, you will be able to navigate your folders using the **Dolphin File Manager.**

In order to open Dolphin, click on your the “**Application Launcher**” button at the bottom left of your screen and type “**Dolphin**“.

![dolphin file manager on kde](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dolphin.png)

Click on the “**Dolphin – File Manager**” option.

Now that Dolphin is open, select the folders to be zipped by holding the “Control” key and left-clicking on the folders to be compressed together.

![select folders on dolphin linux](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/step-1.png)

Now that folders are selected, right-click wherever you want and select the “**Compress**” option.

When hovering your mouse cursor over the “Compress” option and select the “**Here (as ZIP)**” option in the menu.

If you want to zip folders in another location, you will have to select the “**Compress to**” option, specify the location and the compression mode (as ZIP).

After a quick time, depending on the size of your archive, your zip should be created with all the folders you have selected in it.

Congratulations, **you successfully created a zip for your folders on Linux!**

### Compress Folders on GNOME

If you are using GNOME, on [Debian 10](https://devconnected.com/how-to-install-and-configure-debian-10-buster-with-gnome/) or on [CentOS 8](https://devconnected.com/how-to-install-and-configure-centos-8-with-gnome/) for example, you will also be able to compress your files directly from the user interface.

Select the “**Applications**” menu at the top left corner of your Desktop, and search for “**Files**“

![Files file manager on GNOME](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gnome-1.png)

Select the “**Files**” option : your file explorer should start automatically.

Now that you are in your file explorer, select multiple folders by holding the “Control” key and left-clicking on all the folders to be zipped.

When you are done, right-click and select the “**Compress**” option.

![compressing folders using GNOME](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/compress-2.png)

Now that the “**Compress**” option is selected, a popup window should appear asking for **the filename of your zip** as well as the extension to be used.

![naming your archive on GNOME](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/archive.png)

When you are done, simply click the “Create” option for your zip file to be created.

![zip file created on GNOME File manager](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/archive2.png)

That’s it!

**Your folders should now be zipped in an archive file** : you can start sending the archive or extracting the files that are contained in it.

## Zipping Directories using Bash

In some cases, you may not have a graphical interface directly installed on your server.

As a consequence, you may want to zip folders directly from the command-line, using the Bash programming language.

If you are not sure about Bash, here’s a [Bash beginners guide](https://devconnected.com/writing-scripts-on-linux-using-bash/) and another one for more [advanced Bash scripting](https://devconnected.com/advanced-bash-scripting-guide/).

**In order to zip folders using Bash, use the “for” loop and iterate over the directories of the current working directory**

```
$ for file in $(ls -d */); do zip archive.zip $file; done
```

![zip folder using bash](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/for-files.png)

Using bash, you can actually get specific when it comes to the folders to be zipped.

**For example, if you want to zip folders beginning with the letter D, you can write the following command**

```
$ for file in $(ls -d */ | grep D); do zip archive.zip $file; done
```

Congratulations, you successfully **created a zip for your folders** in the current working directory!

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learnt how you can easily **create zip files for your folders on Linux.**

You learnt that it is either possible to do it using the command-line and commands such as zip, find or the Bash programming language.

If you are using a graphical interface (such as KDE or GNOME), you can also zip folders by navigating the file explorer and right-clicking on the folders you are interested in.
