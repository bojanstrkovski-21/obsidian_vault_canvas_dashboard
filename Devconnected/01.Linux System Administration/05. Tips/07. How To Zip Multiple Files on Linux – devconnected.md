## Prerequisites

In order to zip multiple files on Linux, you need to have [zip installed](https://linux.die.net/man/1/zip).

If the zip command is not found on your system, make sure to install it using APT or YUM

```
$ sudo apt-get install zip

$ sudo yum install zip
```

## Zip Multiple Files on Linux

In order to zip multiple files using the zip command, you can simply append all your filenames.

```
$ zip archive.zip file1 file2 file3

adding: file1 (stored 0%)
adding: file2 (stored 0%)
adding: file3 (stored 0%)
```

Alternatively, you can use a wildcard if you are able to group your files by extension.

```
$ zip archive.zip *.txt

adding: file.txt (stored 0%)
adding: license.txt (stored 0%)

$ zip archive.zip *.iso

adding: debian-10.iso (stored 0%)
adding: centos-8.iso (stored 0%)
```

## Zip Multiple Directories on Linux

Similarly, you can zip multiple directories by simply appending the directory names to your command.

```
$ zip archive.zip directory1 directory2

adding: directory1/ (stored 0%)
adding: directory2/ (stored 0%)
```
