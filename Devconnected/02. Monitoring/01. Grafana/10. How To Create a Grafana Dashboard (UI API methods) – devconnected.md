[Grafana dashboards](https://grafana.com/dashboards) are awesome. Whether you are looking to monitor your entire infrastructure, or just your home, everybody benefits from having a complete Grafana dashboard.

In today’s article, we are going to see how we can easily **create a Grafana dashboard**, what the different panels are and how they can be used efficiently.

### **Here are the steps to create a Grafana dashboard using the UI:**

-   Hover the **‘Plus’** icon located on the left menu with your cursor (it should be the first icon)
-   From there, a dropdown will open. Click on the **‘dashboard’** option.

-   A new dashboard will automatically be created with a first panel.

Grafana new panel – query & visualization

In Grafana v6.0+, the query and the visualization panels are separated. It means that you can easily write your query, and decide later which visualization you want to use for your dashboard.

This is particularly handy because you don’t have to reset your panel everytime you want to change the visualization types.

-   First, click on ‘Add Query’ and make sure that your datasource is correctly binded to Grafana.
-   **Write your query** and refactor it until you’re happy with the final result. By default, Grafana sets new panels to “Graph” types.

-   Choose the visualization that fits your query the best. You have to choose between ten different visualizations (or more if you have plugins installed!)

-   Tweak your dashboard with display options until you’re satisfied with the visual of your panel.

-   **Add more panels**, and build a complete dashboard for your needs! [**Here is an example**](https://devconnected.com/monitoring-linux-processes-using-prometheus-and-grafana/) of what a dashboard could be with a little bit of work. Here is an example with a more **[futuristic theme on disk monitoring](https://devconnected.com/monitoring-disk-i-o-on-linux-with-the-node-exporter/)**.

### **Here are the steps to create a Grafana dashboard using the API**:

Most of the API requests are [authenticated within Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/http_api/auth/). In order to call the Grafana API to create a dashboard, you will have to get a token. If you don’t own the Grafana instance, you have to ask your administrator a token.

-   Hover the ‘Configuration’ icon in the left menu and click on the **“API Keys”** option.

![Configuration menu in Grafana](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/api-keys.png)

-   Click on “Add API Key”. Enter a key name and at least an “Editor” role to the key.
-   Click on “Add”

![Add API Key](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/add-api-key.png)

-   A popup page will open and show you the token you will be using in the future. It is very important that **you copy it immediately**. You won’t be able to see it after closing the window.

![API key created in Grafana](https://devconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/grafana-api-key.png)

-   Now that you have your API key, you need to make a call to the */api/dashboards/db* endpoint using the token in the authorization header of your HTTP request.

For this example, I will be using Postman.

-   Create a new POST request in Postman, and type *http://localhost:3000/api/dashboards/db* as the target URL.
-   In the authorization panel, select the **‘Bearer token’** type and paste the token you got from the UI.

-   In the body of your request, select “Raw” then “JSON (application/json)”. Paste the following JSON to create your dashboard.

```
{
  "dashboard": {
    "id": null,
    "uid": null,
    "title": "Production Overview",
    "tags": [ "templated" ],
    "timezone": "browser",
    "schemaVersion": 16,
    "version": 0
  },
  "folderId": 0,
  "overwrite": false
}
```

Here’s the description of every field in the request:

-   dashboard.**id** : the dashboard ID, should be set to null on **dashboard creation**.
-   dashboard.**uid** : the dashboard unique identifier, should be set to null on **dashboard creation.**
-   **title** : the **title** of your dashboard.
-   **tags** : dashboard can be assigned tags in order to retrieve them quicker in the future.
-   **timezone** : the timezone for your dashboard, should be set to browser on **dashboard creation.**
-   **schemaVersion** : constant value that should be **16**.
-   **version** : your dashboard version, should be set to **zero** as it is the first version of your dashboard.
-   **folderId** : you can choose to set a folder id to your dashboard if you already have existing folders
-   **overwrite** : you could update an existing dashboard, but it should be set to false in our case as we creating it.

-   Click on “Send”. You choose see the following success message.

```
{
    "id": 3,
    "slug": "production-overview",
    "status": "success",
    "uid": "uX5vE8nZk",
    "url": "/d/uX5vE8nZk/production-overview",
    "version": 1
}
```

-   Make sure that your dashboard was created in Grafana.
