On Git, **tags** are often used in order to tag specific commits that may be more important than others.

Tags may be used in order to bookmark certain **events** : **releases**, **bug-fixes** or just to add an **informative** and **descriptive** note to a commit.

On GitHub, tags are often associated with **actual product releases** for example.

However, in some cases, you may want to **delete Git tags easily locally or remotely**.

## Delete a local Git tag

**In order to delete a local Git tag, use the “git tag” command with the “-d” option.**

```
$ git tag -d <tag_name>
```

For example, if you wanted to delete a local tag named “v1.0” on your commit list, you would run

```
$ git tag -d v1.0
Deleted tag 'v1.0' (was 808b598)
```

If you try to delete a Git tag that does not exist, you will simply be notified that the tag does not exist.

```
$ git tag -d v2.0
error: tag 'v2.0' not found.
```

If you want to make sure that tags were correctly deleted, simply list your existing tags using the tag command and the “-l” option.

```
$ git tag -l
<empty>
```

## Delete a remote Git tag

**In order to delete a remote Git tag, use the “git push” command with the “–delete” option and specify the tag name.**

```
$ git push --delete origin tagname
```

Back to the previous example, if you want to delete the remote Git tag named “v1.0”, you would run

```
$ git push --delete origin v1.0

To https://github.com/SCHKN/repo.git
 - [deleted]         v1.0
```

To delete a remote Git tag, you can also use the “git push” command and specify the tag name using the refs syntax.

```
$ git push origin :refs/tags/<tag>
```

Back to the example, in order to delete a tag named “v1.0”, you would run

```
$ git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0

To https://github.com/SCHKN/repo.git
 - [deleted]         v1.0
```

> Why should we specify the **“refs/tags”** instead of just specifying the tagname?

In some cases, your tag may have the same name as your branch.

If you tried to delete your Git tag without specifying the “[refs/tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References)” you would get the following error

```
$ git push origin :v1.0

error: dst refspec v1.0 matches more than one.
error: failed to push some refs to '<repository>'
```

As a consequence, you need to specify that you are actually trying to delete a Git tag and not a Git repository.
