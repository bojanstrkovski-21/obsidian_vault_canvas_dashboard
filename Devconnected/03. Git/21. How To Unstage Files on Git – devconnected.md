When working with Git, it is quite common for developers to add all the files to your index in order **to prepare them for commit.**

However, in some cases, you may want to remove files from the index, in other words, **you want to unstage files**.

**Unstaging files is very beneficial** : it can be used to separate files in different commits, or to do work on some other modifications.

In this tutorial, we are going to see **how you can easily unstage your files on Git.**

## Unstage files using git reset

**The easiest way to unstage files on Git is to use the “**[**git reset**](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset)**” command and specify the file you want to unstage.**

```
git reset <commit> -- <path>
```

By default, the commit parameter is optional : if you don’t specify it, it will be referring to **HEAD**.

*So what does this command do?*

This command will **reset the index entries** (the ones you added to your staging area) to their state at the specified commit (or HEAD if you didn’t specify any commits).

Also, we use the double dashes as [argument disambiguation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout#_argument_disambiguation) meaning that the argument that you are specifying may be related to two distinct objects : branches and directories for example.

As a quick example, let’s pretend that you added a file named “README” to your staging area, but now you want to unstage this file.

```
$ git status

On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   README
```

In order **to unstage the README file**, you would execute the following command

```
$ git reset -- README
```

You can now check the status of your working directory again with “git status”

```
$ git status

On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        README

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

As you probably understood it by now, the “**git reset**” command is doing the exact opposite of the “**git add**” command : it removes files from the index.

## Unstage all files on Git

Previously, we have seen how you can unstage a file by specifying a path or a file to be reset.

In some cases, you may want **to unstage all your files** from your index.

**To unstage all files, use the “git reset” command without specifying any files or paths.**

```
$ git reset
```

Again, let’s pretend that you have created two files and one directory and that you added them to your staging area.

```
$ git status

On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   README
        new file:   directory/file
```

In order to unstage all files and directories, execute “git reset” and they will be removed from the staging area back to your working directory.

```
$ git reset 

$ git status

On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        README
        directory/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

## Remove unstaged changes on Git

In some cases, after unstaging files from your staging area, you may want to remove them completely.

**In order to remove unstaged changes, use the “**[**git checkout**](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout)**” command and specify the paths to be removed.**

```
$ git checkout -- <path>
```

Again, let’s say that you have one file that is currently unstaged in your working directory.

```
$ git status

On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   README

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

In order to discard changes done to this unstaged file, execute the “git checkout” command and specify the filename.

```
$ git checkout -- README

$ git status

On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Alternatively, if you want to discard your entire working directory, head back to the root of your project and execute the following command.

```
$ git checkout -- .

$ git status

On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## Unstage commit on Git

In some cases, you actually **committed files** to your git directory (or repository) but you want to unstage them in order to make some modifications to your commit.

Luckily for you, there’s also a command for that.

### Unstage commits softly

**To unstage commits on Git, use the “git reset” command with the “–soft” option and specify the commit hash.**

```
$ git reset --soft <commit>
```

Alternatively, if you want to unstage your last commit, you can the “HEAD” notation in order to revert it easily.

```
$ git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

Using the “–soft” argument, **changes are kept in your working directory and index.**

As a consequence, your modifications are kept, they are just not in the Git repository anymore.

Inspecting your repository after a soft reset would give you the following output, given that you unstaged the last commit.

```
$ git status

On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   README
```

*What happens if you were to hard reset your commit?*

In this case, all changes would be discarded and you would lose your changes.

### Unstage commits hardly

**To unstage commits on Git and discard all changes, use the “git reset” command with the “–hard” argument.**

```
$ git reset --hard <commit>
```

> **Note** : be careful when using the reset hard command, you will lose all your changes when hard resetting.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learnt **how you can unstage files easily on Git** using the “git reset” command.

You learnt that you can either specify a path or a single file to unstage files and keep on working on your files until you commit them to your repository.
