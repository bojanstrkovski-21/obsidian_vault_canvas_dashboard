4.  In the repository settings, scroll down until you see the “**Danger zone**“.
5.  In the “danger zone”, click on “**Delete this repository**“
6.  To confirm the GitHub repository deletion, you have to type the repository name. When you are done, simply click on “**I understand the consequences, delete this repository**“.
7.  Congratulations, you have successfully **deleted your GitHub repository!**

## Delete Local GitHub Repository

In some cases, you don’t want to delete a remote GitHub repository but you only want to delete the copy you got by [cloning the remote repository](https://devconnected.com/how-to-clone-a-git-repository/).

**In order to delete a local GitHub repository, use the “rm -rf” on the “.git” file located at the root of your Git repository.**

```
$ rm -rf <repo_folder>/.git
```

By deleting the “.git” file, you will delete the Github repository but you won’t delete the files that are located in your project folder.

As a consequence, you will be able to initialize a new Git (or Github) repository using “git init”, add a remote using “git remote add” and start committing new files!

```
$ git init

$ git remote add origin git@github.com:<user>/<repository>.git

$ git push -u origin master
```

Careful, if you use the “git push” command without the “-u” option ([for upstream branch](https://devconnected.com/how-to-set-upstream-branch-on-git/)), you will be asked to provide the upstream branch.

Make sure to read our dedicated tutorial if you want to find more information about upstream branches.
